    {\textbf{SESE Senior Exploration Capstone} $|$ \emph{CATIA, Cameo Systems Modeler, Model Based Systems Design, MBSE, Python, Jython,  }}    {}
    \resumeItemListStart
        \resumeItem{Processed and analyzed large thermal dataset in Python. Used graphical and analytic packages to identify trends and potential anomalies in telemetry data.}
        \resumeItem{Imported equations generated by Python script into CAMEO Systems Modeler to create a basic thermal model of the satellite.}
        \resumeItem{Identified potential thermal anomalies and risk factors using the basic model built. This framework could be used to ensure the success of Cubesat missions before launch.}

    {\textbf{Space Works II} $|$ \emph{Siemens NX CAD software, Microsoft Projects, Circuits, Python, Arduino}}{}
    \resumeItemListStart
        \resumeItem{Designed and built an infrared instrument that was required to work in space like conditions. Instrument was built around pre-existing sensor, the instrument body, shutter mechanism, and software were custom.}
        \resumeItem{Worked as the project manager and lead design officer. Designed the instrument body, shutter mechanism, and internal structure in Siemens NX. Printed and assembled components.}
        \resumeItem{Completed system captured 30 images of a thermal Target while under 5 torr. Processed collected data in python to generate heat map, and verify temperature of thermal target was measured to be within +- 2.5 degrees accuracy.}
