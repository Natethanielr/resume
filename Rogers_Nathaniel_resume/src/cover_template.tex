Dear Hiring Manager, 

\bigskip
\bigskip


\hspace{1cm}I was recently referred to the Entry Level Procurement Analyst role with Boeing Defense, Space and Security. I am thrilled at the opportunity to apply; my unique background and skill set make me an excellent candidate. I hold a Bachelors of Science in Earth and Space Exploration with an emphasis in Astrophysics, and have professional experience in finance, management, and customer service. My strong skills in data analysis, project management, and organization align well with the role. \\
\medskip
\hspace{1cm}The rigorous coursework required to achieve a degree in Astrophysics has equipped me with a solid foundation in analytical thinking, data analysis, and problem-solving skills. While pursuing my degree, I branched out and gained experience directly related to a professional career. Participating in a range of systems engineering courses and projects, I gained experience working in team-based projects, simulating professional aerospace environments. Outside my degree path, I have taken courses in project management to hone my teamwork skills and gain a deeper understanding of project management theory. Specifically, I honed my skills of creating schedules, analyzing risk, generating and tracking performance metrics, and leading independent projects. \\
\medskip
\hspace{1cm}I am currently a loan funding processor with Wells Fargo Bank. I coordinate the funding of 5-10 mortgage loans on a daily basis, and I have never missed a deadline or caused a delay in the process. This role requires me to work with a range of external vendors, validate processes and procedures, ensure the accuracy of documents, and abide by strict deadlines. In earlier roles, I worked a range of jobs that helped develop a diverse set of skills. I spent time working as a technician at a bicycle repair shop. I managed orders and created work schedules based on the availability of parts from vendors. During the summers, I managed a water park. This was a high-stress environment where I had to oversee a large team while performing a range of other duties. \\
\medskip
\hspace{1cm}My unique education and work background will bring diverse viewpoints to the team. I have extensive experience--in educational and professional environments--creating schedules, working with suppliers, data analysis, and performance tracking. Working for Boeing has been an aspiration of mine for many years; I am thankful for the opportunity to apply. Boeing's legacy of excellence makes it the ideal environment for me to apply my skills and contribute to advancements in the aerospace industry. \\

Sincerely, \\
