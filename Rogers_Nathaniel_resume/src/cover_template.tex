Dear Hiring Manager, 

\bigskip
\bigskip

    \hspace{1cm} I am writing to express my strong interest in the Associate Procurement Agent at Boeing Defense, Space \& Security. With my background in astrophysics, aerospace project management, and a diverse background in retail and service operations, I am confident in my ability to contribute to the success of The Boeing Company.\\
\medskip
    \hspace{1cm} My academic background is in astrophysics. I am a senior at Arizona State University, graduating in May with a BS in Earth and Space Exploration with an Emphasis in Astrophysics. The rigorous coursework required to achieve a degree in Astrophysics has equipped me with a solid foundation in analytical thinking, attention to detail, and problem-solving skills—qualities essential for effective procurement management. While pursuing my degree, I have been able to branch out and gain experience directly related to a professional career. Participating in SpaceWorks, offered by the School of Earth and Space Exploration, I gained direct experience working in team-based projects, simulating professional aerospace environments. Outside of my degree path, I have taken courses in project management to hone my teamwork skills and gain a deeper understanding of project management theory. \\
\medskip
    \hspace{1cm} In my previous role at Junction Bike Company, I gained practical experience in procurement-related tasks, including ordering and stocking inventory. This role required a keen understanding of supply chain dynamics, inventory management, and vendor relations, skills that I believe are directly transferable to the aerospace sector. I monitored and reviewed the supply and demand of products in the retail space. A crucial role of a service writer was managing and communicating project timelines based on product availability, vendor supply chain, and logistics. Not only did I communicate with established vendors at the shop, I worked to forge relationships with new vendors that offered alternatives and complemented products available at the shop. If the consumer required a part that was not directly available through normal vendors, I evaluated alternative solutions to complete the project in a timely and cost-effective manner. \\
\medskip
    \hspace{1cm}I have a particular interest in The Boeing Company. Boeing has an unparalleled reputation for aerospace innovation and technological advancement. Boeing's commitment to pushing the boundaries of what is possible in aviation aligns seamlessly with my own passion for exploration and discovery, cultivated through my academic background in astrophysics. I am eager to be a part of a team that embraces challenges, fosters innovation, and continues to redefine the possibilities of flight and space exploration. Boeing's legacy of excellence and its commitment to pushing the boundaries of what is possible in aviation make it the ideal environment for me to apply my skills and contribute to the cutting-edge advancements in the aerospace industry.\\
\medskip
    \hspace{1cm}I am confident that my academic background, coupled with my hands-on experience in procurement and inventory management, make me a strong fit for the Procurement Agent role at The Boeing Company. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss further how my skills and experiences align with your company's needs.\\
\medskip
    \hspace{1cm} Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how I can contribute to the success of Boeing Defense, Space \& Security. \\

\bigskip
Sincerely, \\
